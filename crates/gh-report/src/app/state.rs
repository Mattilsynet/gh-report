//! Shared application state for the service.
//!
//! ## State topology
//!
//! `AppState` holds three focused sub-aggregates plus cross-cutting fields:
//!
//! - **[`WebhookState`]** — webhook secret, replay protection, debounce.
//! - **[`GithubState`]** — budget gate, rate limit, API client,
//!   repo detail cache.
//! - **[`EvidenceState`]** — evidence store, HTML cache, WebSocket
//!   broadcast, org summary, batch tracker.
//!
//! Cross-cutting fields (run metadata, work queue, worker pool guard,
//! event bus) remain directly on `AppState`.
//!
//! ## Credential lifecycle
//!
//! GitHub App tokens auto-refresh via `ensure_credential()` on the
//! long-lived client. PAT credential changes via environment variable
//! require a daemon restart.
//!
//! [`REPO_CACHE_TTL_HOURS`]: crate::config::REPO_CACHE_TTL_HOURS
